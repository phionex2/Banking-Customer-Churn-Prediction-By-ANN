# Banking-Customer-Churn-Prediction-By-ANN

<h2>Hii Guys!!</h2>
<p>I have tried to create an Artificial Neural Network on kaggle by taking the dataset of the credit card customer churn prediction. </p>
<ol>
  <li>Firstly we to check the null values and duplicate values</li>
  <li>Now as the data set contains categorical values so we have to convert it into the numerical values by using the one hot encoder</li>
  
</ol>
